# CarGarage

Installation instructions
Clone the project to your ~/wcci/source_code directory.
Open the project in Visual Studio and get started.
Instructions
Open test files and add the Act, Arrange, and Assert portions of the test to match the test name and instructions.
Write production code to make the tests pass.
Make a console application with an instance of a Garage for your user to interact with.
Things to keep in mind
ALL I/O (input and output) should come through the Program class.
ALL logic for the application should be located in the appropriate class (Garage or Car).
Cars should be identified uniquely (assume 'users' will provide unique identifiers of some sort).
Users should ONLY be interacting with individual Cars through the Garage.
